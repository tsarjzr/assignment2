	<div id="content">  <p><strong>Q:How many tropical fish  can I have?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong>The often stated general rule of  thumb (don't stock your tank using this rule!) is 1 inch of fish per gallon of  water. Remember to use the future adult size of your fish when computing the  total inches of fish you can have.</p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong>Can I use tap water to  fill my tank? </p>
  <p><br />
    <strong>A:</strong>Maybe - first for chlorine and or chloramines. Most likely you will have these  chemicals in your water and you will need to remove or neutralize them before  adding water to your tank. </p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong>How  often should I change the water? </p>
  <p><br />
    <strong>A:</strong>It depends on how many fish you  have and the quality of your filtration  system. In lightly stocked tanks, I  would recommend changing 10 percent of the water once a week. </p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong>How  often should I feed my tropical fish? <br />
    </p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong>It is best to give your fish two  or three small feedings per day. Only give an amount of food that the fish can  eat in 2 minutes or less. </p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong>What are  some good tropical fish for beginners? <br />
    <strong>A:</strong>There are a few species that are  particularly hardy and that can tolerate some of the mistakes that a beginner may make. </p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong>Help, I  can't find my fish! Where is it? <br />
  </p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Some fish do jump out, especially when there is no hood or it is  not properly secured. Look all around the tank, including behind it. Another  place to look is inside the filter. Smaller fish can easily get into the  filter's intake tube and it will often, unfortunately, kill them. <br />
  </p>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong>What  should the fish tank temperature be set at? </p>
  <p><br />
    <strong>A:</strong>The aquarium water temperature  depends on the fish species in question. Different species require different  temperatures. Generally speaking, for tropical fish a good temperature range  would be anywhere from 72 째F to 78 째F (22 째C to 26 째C);. </p>
  <p><strong>Q:Can I leave my aquarium lights on  24 hours?</strong></p>
  <p> <br />
    <strong>A:</strong>Your fish need some &quot;down  time&quot; just like you do. Sure, they don't crawl under the covers and go to  sleep, but they do hunker down in a quiet place and rest at night. <br />
