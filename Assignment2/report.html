<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>Your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> The best aspect of working together is the fact that we can make use of every member's talents. For example, when one person is good in speaking English and research, other members may be weak in this aspect. On the other hand, the English speaker may not be as proficient in coding, and the other members who are weak in speaking English are proficient in computing and programming skills.  </p>
<p> Another great aspect of working together is the ability to motivate one another and fill in for each other's needs. For instance if a member is unable to complete a task on time due to other commmitments, one can ask another member to help him/her to complete the task and ensure that all the tasks are complete before the deadlines. </p>
<p> For example, in our group after Michael and Mikkel complete all the tasks, Wayne would often recheck over all the commits made to Github and ensure everything works seamlessly. </p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong> To be frank, our group had a wonderful work kinergy. However if we had to say a limiting factor of working together, it would be how difficult it was to set a time to meet up together. Because every member has a different time schedule and class times, it is diffcult to meet up together.</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> What we have learned through the journey of working together is that sometimes in a team, we cannot be egotistical and self-centered. When one member cannot do something, it does not mean that we can just leave the member to suffer alone. When one person suffers, everybody suffers, when everybody succeeds, the success is shared equally among everybody.</p>
